# Handoff: continuing ctcompile

You are picking up work on `ctcompile`, an ahead-of-time browser-application
compiler being built inside `compile-time-browser`. Everything below is
committed and green; nothing is pushed.

## Where things are

* Repo: `/mnt/c/Users/aange/Downloads/claude/compile-time-browser`
* Branch: **`ctcompile-v1`**, working tree clean
* Suite: **97/97** via `./tools/remote-build.sh`
* **Read `ctcompile/docs/plans/ctcompile.md` first** — it is the running plan in
  the house style (Done / Next, measured rungs) and it records every decision
  below with its reasoning. This file is a pointer to it, not a substitute.

The master plan is 21 markdown files in `../ctcompile-plan/` (NOT in the repo).
`00-START-HERE.md` routes by phase; **`01-objective-and-ground-truth.md`
overrides every other file**. Its six non-negotiables matter: `ctjs` is the
parser only, the bytecode is a REGISTER machine, there is no CI, EmitC is the
primary backend, sources are in `lib/`, build on the devbox.

## What is done

* **Phase -1** — the monorepo split. `ctbrowser/` is the CMake configure root;
  `ctcompile/` is a sibling project.
* **Phase 0** — six inventories the build checks, two differential comparators,
  and a recorded startup baseline. See `ctcompile/docs/baseline/*.json`.
* **Phase 2** — the AOT ABI: `ctbrowser/include/ctbrowser/aot/aot_helpers.def`,
  68 helpers over 84 of the 93 opcodes, expanded by both projects so drift is a
  compile error.
* **Phase 15** — a working program image, wired into the page load.
  `ctbrowser/{include,lib}/…/program_image.*` writes and reads a compiled
  `script::program`, validated exhaustively, and `browser::set_script_image()`
  uses it.

## The number that justifies the project

From `ctbrowser/docs/performance.md`: a whole p5 page load is 17.5% lexing,
15.1% `declare_local`, 7.6% `collect_captured_names` — and **1.4%
`context::run_loop`, the entire interpreter**. About forty percent of a page
load is READING JavaScript; 1.4% is executing it. So this compiler's value is
overwhelmingly in what it **deletes from startup**.

Measured, `ctcompile/docs/baseline/page-load.json`, p5-basic.html on the devbox:

| | ms |
|---|---|
| `load_html` compiling its own scripts | **65.38** |
| `load_html` handed a program image | **19.78** |
| | **70% of the page load** |

## What the last session did

1. **The source hash was 4.16 ms of that page load.** It is now
   `boost::hash2::xxhash_64`, 0.181 ms. **Do not "improve" it to a four-lane
   FNV over 64-bit words** — that was tried, it is faster (0.127 ms), and it
   collides on 50,678 of 262,145 single-byte edits of real p5.js. The plan
   explains why, and `ctcompile/test/ProgramImage.cpp` keeps that hash as a
   blinded control so the case that catches it can be watched failing.
2. **`page-load.json` re-recorded**, 53% → 70%.
3. **Operand validation**: the per-operand switch became a bound table, 19.74 →
   19.18 ms, 15 of 15 paired runs. The "suspect fast path" the previous handoff
   proposed was NOT implemented and should not be — see the plan.

## Do these next

1. **`function_proto::nested` is dead code.** Nothing writes it, and its only
   reader is a check in `p5_ratchet.cpp` that can therefore never fire. The
   image serializes it as a count so the day it starts being filled is a test
   failure. Consider deleting it outright.
2. **Phase 16B is unblocked** — `engine::for_each_rule` exists, so the CSS
   comparator can go from parse-only to compile-checking whenever 16B starts.
3. **Phases 1–6**, the runtime preparation, are the actual ladder. Phase 2 is
   done; 1 and 3–6 are not.

## Known problems, not yet acted on

* **The 65,535 proto ceiling is at 49% on a corpus that already exists.** Three
  of four `op::closure` emitters cast the function index to `uint16` before the
  32-bit `with_bx` (`statements.cpp:613`, `expressions.cpp:95`,
  `classes.cpp:156`; `classes.cpp:109` does not). Above 65,535 protos the
  COMPILER builds the wrong closure. Babylon is 31,905. The image writer refuses
  such a program rather than freezing the bug into a file.
* **The image is keyed to a whole page's concatenated scripts**, because
  `browser::run_scripts` compiles every classic `<script>` into ONE program. So
  editing an inline sketch invalidates the image for the 4.5 MB bundle beside
  it. Splitting per-script is an engine change: `compile_program` hoists
  function declarations across the whole concatenation, so a call in the first
  script to a function declared in a later one works today and would stop.
  **This is what stands between the current win and "bake p5 once, reuse it",
  and it is the highest-value thing left on this path.**
* **The corruption fuzz prints a count it does not assert** —
  `ProgramImage.cpp` reports "1615 of 3205 offsets still loaded" and nothing
  pins it. Pinning it was considered and not done: the number depends on the
  fixture's compiled bytecode, which Phases 13 and 14 renumber deliberately, so
  a ratchet there would churn without signal. If validation changes, prove
  equivalence differentially instead — see the plan's note on the 60,000-mutation
  digest, which is how the bound-table rewrite was shown to be the same function.
* **`@font-face`** — fixed for `url()` in `a2ef736`, but the style engine still
  records a page font only when the family and url are string tokens elsewhere;
  check before assuming.

## How to work here (learned the hard way)

* **BUILD ON THE DEVBOX, ALWAYS**: `./tools/remote-build.sh` from the repo root.
  The WSL box has 7.5 GiB and has been taken down by local builds twice.
* **The devbox self-deallocates after 30 idle minutes.** When ssh times out:
  `cd ../infra/azure-build-server && ./server.sh start`.
* **The devbox shell is zsh, which does NOT word-split unquoted variables.**
  `CXX="clang++ -O2"; $CXX foo.cpp` fails as one word. Inline your flags.
* **Chain gates with `&&`, never `;`** — a `;` after `tools/format.sh --check`
  let an unformatted commit through once.
* **`rsync -az` preserves mtimes, and it will hand you a stale binary.** A
  measurement taken straight after a green `remote-build.sh` reported the OLD
  number, because ninja had relinked the test binary and not `ctpageload`.
  `touch` the source and build the target explicitly before measuring, and
  distrust any figure that exactly matches the arm you were replacing.
* **No hardware perf counters on the devbox** (it is a VM) — `perf stat` reports
  `<not supported>`. Use callgrind for attribution, dhat for allocation, and an
  **interleaved A/B of two binaries** for wall clock. Not a before-and-after
  across sessions: the from-source page-load arm moved 7 ms between sessions
  with no commit that could explain it.
* **Profile the thing itself.** One callgrind run profiled a binary that
  compiled the program to build the image, and the compile drowned the load.

## The discipline that has been earning its keep

* **The positive case is one line; the negative cases are the file.** Every
  comparator here is verified against a deliberately BLINDED implementation, and
  every negative case must be seen going red. The source hash's cases go
  further: the blinded hashes live in the test permanently, and each case
  asserts that its control DOES collide, so a case that stops proving anything
  says so instead of passing.
* **Prove a guard is load-bearing by removing it, and say so plainly when it
  does not go red.** Done for both validation fixes in `59d0339` (one did, one
  did not) and for the Boost.Hash2 configure check, which was verified by
  pointing `CTBROWSER_BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR` at a Boost without Hash2.
* **Silence is not success.** Assert counters, never trust output. That guard
  caught a "58x speedup" that was a loader refusing every corpus.
* **Correct yourself in the record.** Four claims have now been committed and
  later corrected here. The most recent: a hoist that "the compiler cannot do"
  and measurably did not need, reverted with the measurement in the plan.
* **A fast algorithm that is quietly wrong is worse than a slow one.** The
  four-lane FNV was faster than what shipped and would have made the image cache
  accept stale code on one edit in five. Prefer somebody else's algorithm AND
  somebody else's code; check it against a third party's answers.

## Using subagents

The last two sessions used `Workflow` heavily and it paid for itself. Ask agents
to REFUTE a design against the code, not to agree with it. Their best output has
been defects in already-committed work: two memory-safety holes in the image
loader, and two stale standing decisions in `ctbrowser/docs/` that this session's
Boost floor change had invalidated.
