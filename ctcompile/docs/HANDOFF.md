# Handoff: continuing ctcompile

Native work continues on `ctcompile-v1` in the `compile-time-browser` monorepo.
The application driver remains incomplete; native compiler development uses
`ctjs-translate` and `ctjs-opt`. Build on the devbox using `tools/remote-build.sh`
under `/tmp/ctbrowser-devbox-build.lock`, then run the local formatter before
committing. There is no CI. Do not build on the small local machine.

## Saved nullable URI guards and fingerprinting, 2026-09-15 UTC

Resumed the interrupted **6caa728b** full-validation thread, found in this
handoff and AGENT-SYNC. **16b1660d** records its recovered 605 non-lit and
177 lit passes without inventing the disconnected wrapper's missing exit status.
Both histories/unmerged branches were checked; September 7 WIP was already an
ancestor. Three agents reviewed the nullable proof, strict/API quality and repo
complexity/Boost opportunities; root recovered their service-limited drafts,
integrated the changes and ran the gates. No browser/runtime edits.

**b13382ec** separates the complete DOM entry proof from manifest parsing and
fingerprinting. **9517ff21** avoids cloning report-free IR during fingerprinting;
report-bearing input retains clone/clear behavior. Every freshness check remains,
with complete hashing and no cache. Legacy-hash equivalence, nested reports,
source nonmutation and changed-source fingerprints have a regression.

**bb7ba402** compiles the original M guard `if ('string' != typeof t) return t`
on a saved `getAttribute` result before one URI try/catch. The producer remains
`std::optional<std::string>`. A complete branch proof records the exact dominated
String uses, and emission copies its value only inside the selected arm. Null,
empty String, an independent reread, aliases, later DOM mutation and the original
catch snapshot remain distinct. Loose equality is accepted only for two proved
Strings; String-only branch/Invoke results use ordinary owning Strings. No Script,
AOT, generic nullable carrier, handle table or new decoder is emitted.

Focused **3/3 CTests in 131.04s PASS**. DOM Strings now covers **745 Node/VM
observations / eight GCC-Clang binaries / 1,048 source refusals**; the nullable
slice adds **80 observations / 52 refusals**. Both providers, policies and layouts
pass, including result lifetime after document destruction and every incomplete
host-proof budget. A positive-arm source exposed an unreachable importer epilogue
that rejoins a live return; its dead branch is now accepted while every source
operation/effect remains censused. Stable formatting passes **844 C++ / 104 Python /
33 web**; the required pinned formatter's **nine-file / 26-diagnostic** baseline
is byte-identical.

Timing uses unchanged Bootstrap IR, saved baseline/candidate tools, warm-up and
11 alternating pairs on the devbox. Fingerprint command median: **159.20 →
152.11 ms (4.45%)**; instrumented pass: **60.4 → 51.0 ms (15.56%)**. Output and
fingerprints match exactly. Tiny URI lowering measured **8.263 → 8.579 ms**,
so there is no measured general transcompilation speedup. The CLI clears supplied
reports before fingerprinting; its decorated-input timing does not measure the
clone fallback. See [the quality review](native-quality-review-2026-09-15.md).

**Full validation is running** on the committed source under the devbox lock.
Frozen input has **1,462 non-Markdown source files**; the durable remote log and
exit marker are `/tmp/ctcompile-nullable-uri/full.log` and `full.exit`.
No new complete-suite result or Bootstrap admission gain is claimed yet.

**Exact next boundary:** compose the existing helper expansion and URI recovery
inside the fingerprinted DOMSource transaction. The current driver chooses one
based only on a handler in the selected entry; a handler inside M reaches helper
expansion instead. Preserve the original call-site actual/capture/receiver proof,
handler vectors, checked status edges and all-budget rollback; reprove the complete
result before publication. Then original M needs JSON/parse identity and original
lookup order, sequential URI/JSON failure continuations, and mixed primitive/JSON
ownership. JSON lookup precedes decoding; either failure returns the saved input.
Full H, initialization/inheritance, retained config/callbacks and the native
application driver remain open. Evidence: `/tmp/ctcompile-nullable-uri/`.
