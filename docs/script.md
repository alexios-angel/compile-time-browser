# Script — the compiler, the VM, the standard library

`include/ctbrowser/script/` and `src/script/` — `compile.hpp`/`compile.cpp`
(JS -> bytecode; the header declares one function and the .cpp holds the whole
compiler), `vm.hpp`/`vm.cpp` (the register machine), `value.hpp` (NaN boxing),
`bytecode.hpp`, `builtins.hpp`/`builtins.cpp` (the standard library). The DOM
API pages call is not here - that is `shell/bindings.hpp`, in `docs/shell.md`.

## JAVASCRIPT (2026-07-25)

**The MDN breakout tutorial runs, unmodified** — `examples/pong.cpp` loads
`examples/pages/pong.html`, a byte-for-byte copy. `examples/fetchboard.html`
compiles too, and the 66 KB bundled `space-invaders.html` stops at exactly ONE
thing: a regex literal.

The compiler covers the language now: `+=` and friends, member/index `++`, real
`this`, `break`/`continue`/labels, `do..while`, `try`/`catch`/`finally`/`throw`
(VM handler stack, unwinds call frames), computed method calls (`a[m]()` keeps
its receiver), `for..of`/`for..in`, template literals, `switch` (with
fallthrough), `class` + `new` + `extends` + **`super`**, optional chaining,
spread (array and object), computed object keys, `delete`, `in`, `instanceof`,
the bitwise operators (ToInt32/ToUint32, so `-1 >>> 0` is 4294967295), and
`async`/`await`.

**Still rejected, each by name rather than mis-compiled**: `regex` (no regex
engine — this is what stops space-invaders), `yield`/generators, tagged
templates, object-literal get/set accessors. The comma operator is a ctjs
PARSER gap, not a compiler one.

**Functions are objects** — a closure carries a property table, which is where a
class keeps its statics, its `prototype` and the `__home` that makes `super`
resolve against the class a method was WRITTEN in rather than against `this`
(three-deep hierarchies recurse forever otherwise).

**Promises are SETTLED-ONLY**, like the previous engine's: no job queue, no `new Promise(executor)`,
`then` runs its callback immediately. `async function` returns a settled promise
(`op::wrap_promise`, through a factory hook the standard library installs — the
VM cannot build a promise by itself). Enough for `await fetch(url)` and
`.then(r => r.json())`; NOT enough for code that depends on ordering between a
`then` and the statements around it.

**`===` compares STRINGS BY CONTENT** — it compared the NaN-boxed words, which
is right for objects (identity) and singletons and wrong for strings, since two
strings with the same characters are almost never the same allocation. So
`e.code === "Space"` was false for every event, `switch` on a string never
matched a case, and `indexOf`/`includes` could not find a string in an array.
`==` always did compare content, which is why the one page in the suite that
uses it (pong) worked and invaders did not. `NaN`, `Infinity` and `undefined`
are defined globals now too — `NaN` was an undefined global, so `NaN === NaN`
was TRUE.

**Standard library** is `src/script/builtins.cpp` — `Math`, `Array.prototype`
(incl. map/filter/reduce/sort, which call back into the VM via
`context::call`), `String.prototype`, `Number.prototype`, `Object` statics,
`JSON` parse/stringify, `Promise` (resolve/reject/all),
`parseInt`/`parseFloat`/`isNaN`/`String`/`Number`. Reached through **prototype
tables per value kind** (`context::set_prototype`) plus **per-object prototype
chains** (`class`/`extends`). `Math.random` is seeded and DETERMINISTIC by
default — the test story is byte-comparable goldens, and a page drawing with
random cannot have one otherwise.

Top-level `var` is a GLOBAL by design (pages define functions the host calls by
name), so the only frame-0 locals are for..of items and catch parameters — and
those ARE capturable, which is what makes `for (const x of xs) fns.push(() => x)`
close over each element at the top level.

`tests/page_scripts` compiles the real example pages and asserts what each
one does; `tests/vm_basics` has a test per language feature.
